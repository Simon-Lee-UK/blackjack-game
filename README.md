Hey guys. 

I've been working on a Blackjack game. 

I had it semi-working, but now I've decided it's time to learn OOP, so I'm re-writing with OOP. 

The code in the repo contains my OOP design for making a deck. However, it's clunky as hell; there must be a better way!

So your task - clone the repository, and see if you can streamline my ridiculously clunky code!
