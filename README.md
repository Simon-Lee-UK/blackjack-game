# Python Blackjack Game

Alex started work on a blackjack game. He had it semi-working, but decided it was time to learn OOP, so he went off and
re-wrote it within his own repo using OOP. His code is still accessible as legacy code in the files:
- Blackjack OOP.py
- Blackjack_OOP.py

Since, Simon has been contributing to his own version of the game. Similarly, he has been going for an object-oriented
approach. This version is run by calling the 'blackjack_main.py' file from the command line or running this script in
your favourite IDE. This file currently has three supporting modules:
- deck.py
- hand.py
- card.py
